Only the extraordinary belong in the kingdom of Ilya—the exceptional, the empowered, the Elites. Surviving in the slums as an Ordinary is no simple task, and Paedyn knows this better than most. When Paeydn unsuspectingly saves one of Ilyas princes, she finds herself thrown into the Purging Trials. The brutal competition exists to showcase the Elites’ powers—the very thing Paedyn lacks. If the Trials and the opponents within them don’t kill her, the prince she’s fighting feelings for certainly will if he discovers what she is—completely Ordinary.',

Eli King might be a savage devil, but I’m out of his way. And league. That is until I wake up in a hospital and find him holding my hand. He tells me the words that change my life forever. “We got married two years ago, Mrs. King.” So I set out to investigate how I landed myself into this marriage. Turns out, my memories are darker than my present. I thought I could handle his soulless eyes and cold shoulder. I thought wrong. Nothing can stop my husband. Not the secrets surrounding us. Not the hatred between us. Not for me.',

Nowhere in Christian’s plans had he ever prepared for Gianna. She’s chaos embodied, not his type, and married, but none of that can stop his eyes from following her wherever she goes. All along, she doesn’t even know that she’s his—his frustration, his fascination. His maddest obsession.',
